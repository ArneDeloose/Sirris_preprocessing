# Sirris_preprocessing
Pre-processing notebook of the Sirris wind turbines dataset (Research program AI Flanders - GC1 PoC )

This Github folder contains three  files. A Jupyter notebook for the pre-processing (WindTurbinesSirris_Notebook_FullConversion.ipynb), a second one to correct for the weather (WindturbinesSirris_Notebook_WeatherPred.ipynb) and a pdf (Sirris_Data pre-processing.pdf) which explains each step of the pre-processing in greater detail.
